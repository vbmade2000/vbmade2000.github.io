## Who we are
We are bunch of Rust lovers. We are not satisfied with our daily use and learning of Rust so We have started Pangolin Solutions as a side hustle to gain more experience particularly in Rust programming language.

## What do we do
We develop software solutions using Rust programming language. Being in an infancy stage, we can't afford to choose domain as we might loose some good projects. We mostly have experience in web development but we can work on projects in other domains too.

## Why Rust
We strongly believe that Rust is a programming language for next era. We trust Rust because of following characteristics.

- **Performance**
Garbage collection and runtime are two major factors that make applications slow. Thanks to Rust's ownership model and    borrow checker, Rust don't need garbage collection or runtime.

- **Reliability**
Due to ownership model, Rust prevents many class of bugs including resource leaks, handling of case, Dangling pointers. Thus it prevents security issues like Stack Overflow, Memory leaks etc. Rust compiler catches concurrency related bugs too. This way developers are free to focus on actual business logic instead of worrying about such bugs.

- **Energy efficiency**
Somebody rightly said "The greenest energy is the energy we don't use". Rust delivers efficient and performant applications even with large applications and so application developed using Rust is as energy efficient as C. There is a nice article by Amazon showing that. You can read it here.
